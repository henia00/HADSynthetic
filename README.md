# HADSynthetic
Tool to browse the database of theoretical models of High-Amplitude Delta Scuti stars (HADS).

## Models
Theoretical models are calculated with the MESA evolutionary code and Warsaw pulsation code as described in detail by Netzel & Smolec (2022).

We provide the tool to browse through the database. The User needs to select mass, metallicity [Fe/H], and overshooting to see the evolutionary track of a star with given parameters.

## Tools

HADSynthetic will provide the tools for interactive asteroseismic modeling of multi-mode radially pulsating HADS and SX Phoenicis stars.
